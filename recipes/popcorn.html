    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Popcorn is a variety of corn kernel which expands and puffs up when heated; the same names are also used to refer to the foodstuff produced by the expansion. A popcorn kernel's strong hull contains the seed's hard, starchy shell endosperm with 14â€“20% moisture, which turns to steam as the kernel is heated.</p>
