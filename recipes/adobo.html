    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Adobo is a Filipino dish made by braising chicken legs (thighs and/or drumsticks) in a sauce made up of vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and black pepper. It's tangy, salty, garlicy, slightly sweet, and spicy. The chicken is slowly simmered in the sauce making it flavorful and incredibly tender.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>chicken thighs</li>
        <li>soy sauce</li>
        <li>vinegar</li>
        <li>msg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned â€“ about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through.
            Remove chicken skillet and set aside.
            Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.
            Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.
            Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.
            If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.</li>
    </ol>
